# SwaggerApiTestingWithCsharpAndRestsharp
Brief description of the assesment:

1.In this assesment, I created two project.

*ApiProject is for the data transfer object class,helper class and swagger class,which includes 
some usefull methods used for the get requests.

*SwaggerApiTestProject only includes the SwaggerTestClass,in which I created all the api test methods 

2.To be able to integrate these two projects with each other, I added the ApiTestProject as a project reference for  SwaggerApiTestProject.

*if you would like to run the tests, kindly open the SwaggerTestClass in SwaggerApiTestProject.
